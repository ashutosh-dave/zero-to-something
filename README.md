# Zero to Something

> "I'm not where I want to be — and I'm not making peace with that."

This is my **journey of becoming the version of Ashutosh I know I’m meant to be**.  
A raw, consistent, week-by-week log of everything I’m learning, building, writing, and improving — in public.

## 🧭 What is this?

**`zero-to-something`** is my personal repo to track weekly missions as I improve my:
- Python skills
- DSA (C++) problem-solving
- JavaScript fundamentals
- Technical writing & blogging
- Public presence on Twitter & LinkedIn

Each week has its own folder with:
- A clear mission
- Daily breakdown
- Code commits (Python, DSA, JS)
- Blog drafts & reflections
- Notes from papers, books, blogs, and videos

---

## 📅 Weekly Structure

Each week includes:
- 📘 **Reading**: Technical blogs, beginner research papers, and CS books  
- 💻 **Coding**: Python dev, C++ DSA, JavaScript  
- ✍️ **Writing**: Blog post, paper summaries, tech reflections  
- 🌐 **Public Sharing**: Twitter & LinkedIn posts  
- 📦 **Delivery**: End-of-week blog + GitHub updates

## 📌 Why?

Because discipline is hard.  
Because I’ve made plans and dropped them.  
Because I want this one to stick.  
Because I want to build — something that matters.  
And this time, **I’m holding myself accountable, in public.**
