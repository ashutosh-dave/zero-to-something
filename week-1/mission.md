# Week 1 â€“ Mission Plan

## Duration
**Sunday to Saturday**

---

## Objective
To build consistency, discipline, and momentum by combining technical skill-building with public accountability. This week focuses on Python development, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), foundational JavaScript, and the beginning of a digital presence through blogs and social platforms.

---

## Weekly Goals

- Strengthen Python fundamentals and explore practical applications.
- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking through C++ DSA practice.
- Get started with JavaScript basics.
- Begin engaging with the tech community via blogging and Twitter.
- Document learnings daily and reflect weekly.
